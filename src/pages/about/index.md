title: Our Process
---
We understand that your home is a huge investment and that renovations can be overwhelming. To make this less stressful, we have outlined below what our renovation process will look like and how we will walk with you through each step of the process.

### Step 1: Free At-Home Consultation

We will start the process with a free at-home consultation where we will discuss your renovation dreams and create a renovation plan that will fit your budget and style. 

### Step 2: Plans & Drawings

Depending on the scope of your project, if there are structural elements involved, then an architect or engineer will need to be involved to plan your project safely. We will work with a local design firm to create renovation plans (this part of the project will require a payment in order for us to pay the professionals who will be making your plans). 

### Step 3: Estimate

Based on your renovation plans we will create an estimate for your project that includes our expected timeline for the work to be completed. We aspire to be as transparent as possible with you in the quoting process so you can understand exactly where your money is going and can prioritize accordingly. 

### Step 4: Project Proposal & Decision

We will present you with our project proposal, design plans and budget and will give you time to ask questions, make changes and make your final decision about working with us. 

### Step 5: Sign Contract & Provide Deposit

If you decide to work with us we will have you sign a contract and make a deposit to hold your spot in our workload. 

### Step 6: Permit Application

We will use the design plans to apply for a permit on your behalf if it is required for your project.

### Step 7: Project Initiation

Once we have the construction permits we will set a start date with you and start ordering materials for your project. 

### Step 8: Ongoing Project

We understand that living in renovations is difficult (we've done it!) so we will keep you regularly updated along the way about the progress we are making and when we expect your house to be renovation-free again! We also work hard to keep the job-site as clean and tidy as possible to minimize your stress. 

### Step 9: Project Completion

Before completion we will do a final walk-through with you and make sure you are fully satisfied with our work and that your home feels like yours!
