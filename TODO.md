  - [x] Hannah: provide 32x32 and 16x16  pngs (of picture you want in tabs/ shortcuts)
- [x] Change colours
  - [x] Hannah: send color codes for each colour change

- [x]Could you removed the "mainpitch" section on the landing page? The one where i put 1 and 2 in, I don't think we need it

- [x]And for the black bar at the bottom of the page, could you change it to colour code #000000 and the wording box colour at the top that is blue right now to colour code #456968?
- [x]I'm wondering if it is possible to change the wording under the blurbs to be centered under the picture?
- [x] Is it possible to put the blurbs on both pages into rows of 3 instead of rows of 2? To make it look more filled out?
- [x] And is it also possible to change the buttons on the landing pages for services and blog to be outlined in black instead of red?
